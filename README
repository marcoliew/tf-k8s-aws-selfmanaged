Terraform Cloud currently does not support OpenID Connect (OIDC) as a method for authentication directly within the backend "remote" block. For backend authentication with Terraform Cloud, the primary methods are:

Terraform Login (terraform login): This is the most common method, where a personal access token is generated for your user and stored locally in ~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json.

Environment Variable (TF_CLOUD_TOKEN): Set this environment variable in your shell or CI/CD environment to avoid storing the token locally.

Embedded Token in Configuration: Tokens can be embedded within the backend configuration directly (not recommended for security reasons).

If login is successful, Terraform will store the token in plain text in
the following file for use by subsequent commands:
/home/marco/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
